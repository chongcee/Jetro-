                        <p>The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for
                            high-speed
                            data
                            streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of
                            4K
                            resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for

                            Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward

                            with

                        <img src="Pics/Xbox.png">
                        <p>The Xbox Series X has higher-end hardware and supports higher display resolutions (up to 8K
                            resolution), along with higher frame rates and real-time ray tracing; it also has a
                            high-speed
                            solid-state drive (SSD) to reduce loading times. The less expensive Xbox Series S uses the
                            same
                            CPU,
                            but has a less powerful GPU, has less memory and internal storage, and lacks an optical
                            drive.
                            Both
                            consoles are designed to support nearly all Xbox One games, controllers and accessories,
                            including
                            those games from older Xbox consoles supported by Xbox One's backwards compatibility. At
                            launch,
                            Microsoft positioned their first-party games and several third-party games to be available
                            for
                            both
                            Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One to help transition between generations, providing the "Smart

                            Xbox Game Pass, as well as the cloud game-streaming platform Xbox Cloud Gaming</p>
